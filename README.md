# happyhour README

This is the Visual Studio Code extension for automatic capitalization tracking via [happyhour](https://happyhour.rvapps.io).

## Initialization

After installing, `command-shift-p` and run `Happyhour init`. You will be prompted for your happyhour API token from [https://happyhour.rvapps.io/api_tokens](https://happyhour.rvapps.io/api_tokens). The extension will then automatically send your capitalization time to happyhour (and from happyhour to Jira if you've added your Jira API token to happyhour).
